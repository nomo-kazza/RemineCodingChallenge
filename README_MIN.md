Hi,

To accomplish this coding challenge I used two react components which are https://github.com/schrodinger/fixed-data-table-2 and https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized. Both are actively maintained in their GitHub repository and used for efficiently rendering large lists and tabular data. But react virtualized has more star, contributors and faster than fixed-data-table-2 component.

You can check their performance by uncommenting each component from line 29 to 31 of RemineTable.js file. Or you can also compare the chrome dev tool performance profile screenshot of each component for both loading and filtering.


Best Regards
